In this blogpost we look back at our [satRday in Newcastle 2019](https://newcastle2019.satrdays.org/).

# What makes satRdays?

SatRdays are community led events that celebrate R and its useRs.
In general a satRdays is slightly larger than a typical meetup but
smaller than a multi day conference. SatRdays are one day events and the tickets
should cost less than a full day of minimal wage work. The goal is to have a
small gathering of r-users and speakers. Think of it like multiple meetups
stacked on top of each other into 1 day, a Saturday.

Our satRday in Newcastle was a great success. We had 12 talks and very happy
useRs. The event ran very smoothly and almost everything went according to plan.
We had space for 100 attendees, and every place was used. 

# Planning a SatRday event


## Size of the event
Do you keep to 1 track or will there be parallel speakers? If you do, people have to walk from one place to another, and talks
that run out of time hold up everyone who wants to attend a different talk. If you choose a single track, you will have to think about the level of the talks. A mix of talks that cater to an audience of novices
and experts. 

We decided on a single track, mostly because it was our first time and we wanted to keep it simple. 
We could have divided up the room into 2 but decided not to. In fact there were many people, who considered themselves advanced useRs,
who said they would never had gone to the dplyr talk if they had an other option, but they were pleasantly surprised to have
learned new stuff.

## How to find help
Talk to people, over Slack, email, phone or read in the [knowledgebase](https://knowledgebase.satrdays.org/).

## How to find speakers
It's nice if you have a better known speaker (keynote) for your event, that speaker will draw more people and possibly other speakers. You can contact speakers and/or you send out
a call for papers. Don't forget to call upon people you know (even only vaguely).
We set up a list of potential speakers that we wanted to see. We had arranged for Mara Averick to be the keynote speaker very early on so that helped us a lot. We used the
Rladies network to contact potential speakers and used common slack groups, Twitter and even Linkedin to connect to speakers. We also set up a 'Call for speakers' via sessionize. This system allowed us to receive and order the responses that people send in. We also used sessionize to send our speakers
information, confirmation and modify their talk length. This worked really well.

## How to promote the event
You do not organize this event solely for yourself to listen to your favorite speakers, you want other people to enjoy those speakers as well. Think about your
audience, who do you want to reach? students, professionals? on what level? in what field? 
Our attendees learned about our event through Linkedin, Twitter but also through announcements in meetups. In the future we could send messages to other R user
groups, student associations, and professional organizations. Our audience was mostly beginners and novices with a few advanced useRs as well.

## How to find sponsors

Thank our sponsors

The satRdays are supposed to be cheap. But even so it helps if there is some money other than the money from the ticket sales. You can make list of things
that can be sponsored: stickers, video, website advertisement, breakfast, goodies, posters, lunch, drinks etc. 

To help us in negotiations we made a list of things to sponsor:
video editing, food, advertisement on the webpage etc. We did not want posters, banners or promoted talk at the event, because we felt that no one really wanted
to listen to promoted talks and posters and banners wouldn't really work. We did have a sponsor that was unfit in hindsight.

# WSo what did people think?
We sent out forms. XX% responded

## Show plots etc


## Inclusivity
Something about offering a nursing room.
